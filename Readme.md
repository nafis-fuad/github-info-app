This is a command line application for consuming the Github REST API built as part of a practice project with the intention to try out the typescript language.

### Usage:
Follow the steps to try the app:

1. Clone the app typing this command in the terminal:  
    `git clone https://github.com/nafis-fuad/github-info-app.git`
2. Change into the directory:
    `cd github-info-app`
3. Install the dependencies:
    `npm install`
4. Compile the Typescript files with the task:
    `npm run compile`
5. Run the program with your username like so:
    `npm start your-username`  


### Development:
If you want to look under the hood, start from the *src* folder because it's the root directory. Type `npm run watch` into the terminal for automatic compilation of the typescript files on each file change.

And Have fun Coding.
